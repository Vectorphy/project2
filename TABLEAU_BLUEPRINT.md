# Tableau Dashboard Blueprint

## A. Dashboard Questions (The "Why")
List the 3 key questions this dashboard answers:

1.  **Geography of Impact:** Which specific regions show the deepest "Resilience Gap" after 2020?
2.  **Volatility Transfer:** Do "Indirectly Involved" Third World nations suffer higher inflation variance than "Directly Involved" First World nations?
3.  **The Safe Haven Effect:** Is there a negative correlation between Inflation and FDI in developing nations (capital flight) versus developed nations?

## B. Data Dictionary
List the key fields generated by tableau_prep.py that the user will find:

-   **Metric_Resilience_Gap:** (Float) The GDP growth difference (Post-Crisis minus Pre-Crisis).
-   **Metric_Volatility:** (Float) Standard deviation of inflation over the 24-year period.
-   **War_Status:** (String) Categorical tag (War/Peace) for filtering.
