# Asymmetric Resilience: 12-Country Econometric Study

## Project Overview
This project performs an econometric analysis of war-induced shocks on macroeconomic indicators across 12 countries, aiming to quantify resilience differences between First World and Third World nations.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(Note: Use `req.txt` if that is the provided filename in your copy)*

## Workflow

1.  **Fetch & Process Data**:
    ```bash
    python data_pipeline.py
    ```
    Fetches data from World Bank, cleans it, assigns conflict status, generates `PRELIMINARY_REPORT.md`, and saves `processed_data.csv`.

2.  **Run Analysis**:
    ```bash
    python run_analysis.py
    ```
    Calculates econometric gaps (Volatilty, Resilience Gap) and correlations, saving the output to `FINAL_ANALYSIS_RESULTS.txt`.

## File Manifest

*   **`data_pipeline.py`**: Fetches, cleans, and processes World Bank data, generating a preliminary report and CSV dataset.
*   **`analysis_engine.py`**: Contains the `EconometricAnalyzer` class with methods for volatility, resilience gap, and correlation analysis.
*   **`run_analysis.py`**: Driver script that loads the processed data and executes the econometric analysis.
*   **`processed_data.csv`**: The final cleaned dataset (generated by the pipeline).
